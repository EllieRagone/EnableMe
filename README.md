Enable Me
==========

An app that recommends you buy more games (because you didn't buy enough during the last Steam Sale)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common phrase among those I interact with on the interwebs when trying to decide whether or not to buy a game is "Enable Me, Please?" It's a plea for a nudge in the direction of imprudent buying decisions. 

EnableMe was built as a fun experiment. I noticed that Steam (my preferred game-buying source) lacked a fully fleshed out (or at least well highlighted) recommendation engine. Given the fact that Steam already comes with friends lists, and that games are rated by critics (not unlike movies), I felt that a Netflix-style ratings system would be a nice addition.

This is also my first Rails app, so my apologies for the likely hideous code. I'll do my best to fix mistakes, so feel free to point them out. Just try to be nice.
